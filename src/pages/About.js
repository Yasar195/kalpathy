                Temples are numerous in Palakkad. One being attached to each of the twenty gramams
                in the town. The Chief and most important as well as the most richly endowed is the
                Kalpathy Temple dedicated to Shiva a low quadrangular building on the banks of the
                river of that name. The Car festival held in November is the biggest in the taluks and
                collects more than 20,000 people.

                The Siva Temple mentioned in the Malabar Gazetteer is the Temple dedicated to Sree
                Visalakshi Sametha Sree Viswanathaswamy, popularly known as 

                "KASI VISWANATHASWAMY TEMPLE". This Temple is situated on the south banks of the
                Neela River called also as Kalpathy River (a tributory of Bharathapuzha) in the midst of
                the four Brahimn Agraharams- New Kalpathy, Old Kalpathy, Chathapuram and
                Govindarajapuram.

           <p className="m-4 px-3 text-base md:m-6 ">
                        The legend goes that a Brahmin lady by name Lakshmi Ammal, while returning from
                Kasi had brought a Siva Lingam known as "Bana Lingam" from Kasi. On reaching
                Kalpathy, seeing the developing Agraharams and the environment of the sacred river,
                she had a desire to consecrate the Siva Lingam on the banks of the river. The then
                Palakkad Raja, called Sri Sekharivarman Raja, readily agreed to the request and
                extended all help for the construction of the Temple. He had entrusted the
                construction of the Temple to one of his family members Sri Itty Kombi Achan of
                Konikkal Edam. Raja also set apart certain properties of his own for the upkeep and
                maintenance of the Temple. The lands set apart and the income therefrom were made
                inam or revenue free.

                There is an inscription in "Kolezhuthu" on a stone slab placed in front of the Temple
                between the flag staff and the Nandi Mandapam outside the Temple, withing the
                Temple courtyard. This inscription records endowments made for the Temple. According
                to the inscription the temple was constructed in Malayalam Era 600 (1424-1425). The
                village sites of old Kalpathy, New kalpathy, Chathapuram and Govindarajapuram are all
                included within the boundaries of the lands gifted as per the stone inscription.

                Palakkad Raja had also entrusted the maintenance of the Temple to Shri Itty Kombi
                Achan of the Konikkal Edam. Even today, the Trusteeship of the Temple is entrusted to
                the seniormost member of the Konkkal Edam. The present Trustee is Sri V.K. Gopinatha
                Varma, assisted by Sri. V.K. Manikanta Varma of Konikkal Edam for day to day
                maintenance.

                The land reforms of recent times had deprived the Temple of the income from these
                lands. The Temple at present is being run by the offerings of the devotees and
                vazhipadu collections.

                            The idols of Lord Viswanathaswamy and Sree Vislakshi are attached to the pedestals by
                "Ashtagandham", Sree Viswanathaswamy idol is a "Bana Lingam". The Bana Lingam has
                some special features. Maravur Ganesa Sastrigal in his book "Vedic Religion and Manas
                Tatvam" has explained the divine quality of Bana Lingam. Bana Lingam and Saligramam
                are produced by the sacred rivers Gana and Narmada and they have the power of
                attrating the mind of devotees, just like magnet.

                The Siva Lingam extends four carpenter's angul (inch) higher than the pedestal. The
                circumference at the level of the pedestal may be about eight angul (inches). Sree
                Visalakshi idol stands twenty four inches above the pedestal up to the top of the
                crown.

                The Parivara Devatas in the Temple are Lord Soorya, Ganapathi, Dakshinamoorthy,
                Chandikeswarar, Gangadharaswarar, Subramania Swamy and Kala Bhairavar. The
                "Kanaka Sabha" is adorned by Lord Nataraja and the Utsava Vigrahams. Navagraha
                Devathas with their consorts is a recent prathishta in the Temple. A Nandi Mandapam
                has been set up in front.

                The pooja in the Temple is being performed on the pattern of the pooja held in the
                Mayurnathar Temple situated in Mayavaram, Tamil Nadu. It is believed that at the time
                of the construction of the Temple, the Brahmin lady Lakshmi Ammal who had brought
                the Siva Lingam as also the Vedic Pandits who had migrated from Tmil Nadu and settled
                in the nearby Agraharams had expressed a desire that the Puja be held as is being done
                in the Mayuranathar Temple. The daily Puja and festivities are being held accordingly,
                following Tamil Agamam - Kamikagamam. It is noteworthy that the Thanthi of this
                Temple Shri Ratna Sabapathi Sivaehariar z had his Adhyayanam from the Agama
                Patasala of Mayavaram.

                The Nitya Pooja in the Temple is performed four times a day; Usha Pooja at 5.45 A.M.
                Uchakala Pooja at 9.45 A.M. evening Deeparadhana at 5.45 P.M and Ardhayama Pooja at
                7.45 P.M. Ardhayama Pooja is most important. It commences with "Dhara" including Milk
                Abhishekam. After Alankaram and Deeparathana to the Lord and Goddess, Lord
                Viswanatha is taken out in a procession in the Dolak by devotees around the Temple
                accompained by Vadya Ghosham and placed along with the Goddess in the "Palli Arai",
                the devotees presenting Shobhana Sangeetham. The day's Pooja concludes with the
                Deeparathana to the Lord and Goddess in the Palli Arai.

            <p className="m-4 px-3 text-base md:m-6 pb-5">
            Pradosha Pooja is performed every fortnight. Other periodical festivals include Vishu Kani on Vishu day, Vaisaka Utsavam in the month of Edavam. Navarathri in Kanni for nine days, on the last day of which Vazha Vettal by the Trustee symbolises Narakasura Vadham.

            <a href="/"><p className=" heads mx-4  px-3 text-xl md:mx-6 ">Car Festival</p> </a>
            <p className="m-4 px-3 text-base md:m-6 pb-5">
                        The most important festival of this Temple is the "Car" festival, which is conducted on the last nine days of Tamil month of Aippasi (Thula-Malayalam). This synchronises with the car festival of Mayuranathar Temple of Mayavaram.
            The three adjacent Temples - Manthakkara Maha Ganapathy, Lakshinarayanaswamy temple of Old Kalpathy and Ganapathy temple of Chathapuram - also participate in this Car festival. The festival commences with dwjarohanam. During the nine days special poojas and Veda parayanam by eminent scholars brought from different parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. In the evenings the Utsava Vigrahams are decorated and taken out in procession with special nadaswaram through the four villages. All the houses of the villages offer nivedyam and harathi to all the deities at the time they pass through each house.
            On the fifth day, a mini car festival is conducted in the night, when the iodls are taken out in specially decorated cars through the four villages. The congregation of these cars at a specified spot in New Kalpathy is great event and the devotees take this opportunity to worship all the deities at one and the same spot together. This rehearsal of the main car festival attracts a large number of people from the neighbouring places.
            It is not very clear when the car of Sree Viswanathaswamy Temple was originally constructed. There are three cars for this temple; the biggest is used for Sree Viswanathaswamy, the second biggest for Ganapathi and third one for Sree Subramaniaswamy with consorts Valli and Devayani.
            There is evidence to show that the car of Manthakkara Maha Ganapathy was built for the first time in 1885. The cars of the other two temples of Old Kalpathy and Chathapuram might have been built at about the same time or so. There is no evidence on this matter.
            The actual car festival of Sree Viswanathaswamy Temple is performed during the last three days. On the seventh day of the festival the "Ratharohanam" is conducted. The decorated utsavaa vigrahams after conducting Kalyana Utsavam for Lord Viswanathaswamy and Visalakshi are placed on each car in the morning with Veda Parayanam, Upanished Parayanam and special Vadhyam. The cars are taken through New Kalpathy on the first day, through the Kalachatti Street (Single Street of Old Kalpathy) and Chathapuram on the second day and through Old Kalpathy on the last day, before it reaches its base on the evening of the last day of the festival.
            On the last day of the car Festival, the Rathams of Chathapuram and old Kalpathy Agraharams join with the Rathams of Sri Viswanathaswamy Temple in front of the Temple. This "Sangamam" is a great sight when devotees could pray all the godes at one Place. This Sangamam attracts Thousand of devotees. From time Immemorial the Visawnatha swamy Ratham is pushed by Elephents also. This Age old Practice is continued evan to-day.
            The Ratholsavam Conducted in November every year in Kalpathy is the biggest festival in Palakkad. It has now assumed great Importance short of declaring it as a National Festival. Local Holiday is declared in Palakkad and all Educational Institutions and Offices It attracts a sizable number of foreignn touristes also.

                        According to Agama sastras, renovation and Kumbabhishekam of temples are to be conducted once in Twelva years. The two earlier jeernodharanam and kumbabhishekam of this Temble were Conducted in 1956 and 1981. It is more than 25 years since major repaires were undertaken
            The Temple structure including the Girbagriham had devoloped..extensive damages. Some serious efforts were undertaken to start the project. and they required immediate attention toprevent further damages. Some serious efforts were undertaken to start the project. Under the stewarship of the then trustee Shri. K.V Suseel Kumar Varma, a committee was constituted with Shri. K.N. Lakshminarayan as Secretery, with the approval of the then Hindu Religious Endowment Board under their order No. A3/5165/2005 dated 20-11-2005. The renowned Temple renavation experts, the Vastuvidya Prathishtanam of Kozhikode was kind enough to give a project Report for the reconstruction of the Temple. The ranovation work was undertaken under the Supervision of Engineers of the Vastuvidya Prathishtanam. The jeernodharanam work was completed at a cost exceeding over one Crore Rupees in the year 2008 with the liberal contribution of devotees.
            The mahakumbabhishekam was conducted on 11-5-2008 in a very religious manner as per Shivagama Shastram with Chathurveda, Ithihasa and Purana Parayanam under the leadership of Mayiladuthurai Shivasree Swaminatha Shivacharyer, Temple poojakar Shri Rajalinga Thanthri Shivacharyar and Thantri Sree Ratna Sabhapathi Sivacharyar, in a very grand manner with the co-operation and active partipantion of residents and devotees.
            Our Temple is popularly known also as "KASI VISWANATHA SWAMY TEMPLE". The special reason for this may be that the Prathishta here is a "BANA" lingam brought from the Holy Kasi. The devotees consider that a darsan in this Temple is equal to a visit and prayer in the Banaras Viswanathaswamy Temple. Another significant point is that the Poojas here are conducted in a most devotional and religious manner. The poojakars involved in this are: ThanThri
